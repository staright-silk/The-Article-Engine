# The Article Writer

The Article Writer is a Django-based web application that implements a lightweight article search engine using Whoosh.  
It allows long-form articles to be indexed and searched efficiently using TF-IDF scoring.

This project focuses on clarity, structure, and learning, while providing a solid foundation for building custom text search systems.

## How It Works

1. Articles are indexed using Whoosh
2. Django handles incoming HTTP requests
3. Search queries are parsed and scored using TF-IDF
4. Matching articles are returned and rendered as HTML

---

## Current Status

- Core search engine implemented
- Django integration completed
- GitHub version control configured
- UI kept minimal for clarity

---

## Future Improvements

- Article upload through Django admin
- Search result highlighting
- Filtering and sorting options
- Improved UI styling
- Public deployment
